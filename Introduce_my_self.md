ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Magicmel0n, a French student passionate about technology and science.
ðŸš€ Iâ€™m currently exploring Python and its applications in app development, web scraping, and data science.
ðŸ”¬ Iâ€™m also curious about all kinds of scientific fields!
ðŸ’¡ Always eager to learn, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies.
ðŸ’• Iâ€™m not looking for a collaborator yet, but Iâ€™m always open to discussions and advice!
